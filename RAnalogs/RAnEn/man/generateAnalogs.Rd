\title{RAnEn::generateAnalogs}
\usage{
generateAnalogs(configuration)
}
\arguments{
\item{configuration}{A configuration object generated by the function
\code{\link{generateConfiguration}}. As a good practice, the configuration object
should be validated by the function \code{\link{validateConfiguration}} before
usage.}
}
\value{
An AnEn list with customized members. The list member \bold{analogs}
is a 5-dimensional array that contains values and indices of ensemble
members from the variable observations. The dimensions are
\bold{analogs\link{test stations, test days, FLT, members, ...}}
where FLT stands for forecast lead time. The size of the fifth dimension
is 3, storing the value \link{,,,,1}, station index \link{,,,,2}, and day index
\link{,,,,3}. The list member \bold{similarity} stores the similarity metrics.
The dimension indication is the same with the member analogs. The list
member \bold{searchStations} stores the search station index. The list member
\bold{mapping} stores the mapping mechanism from the time and the flt in
forecasts to the time in observations. For negative values in the member time
index column for analogs and similarity, please refer to

\description{
RAnEn::generateAnalogs returns the generated analog ensembles with either
ensemble values and/or ensemble index. It can also return a number of
auxiliary information, for example, similarity metrics and search stations.
These can be customized in the configuration object generated by the
function \code{\link{generateConfiguration}}.
