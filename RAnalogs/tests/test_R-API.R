# This script is used for manual test procedure to ensure that the results from
# lastest version of R API development is consistent with the standard results. This
# serves as a way to avoid bugs.
#
# Datasets used in this test include:
# - Wind dataset from Luca research
# - Solar dataset
#
# If the test result is `TRUE` which suggests the results from the development
# version and the standard results are the same, the development version 
# theoretically should be free of bugs.
#

# Set this directory to where the data reside
