If you haven't done so, please read [the instructions for basic usage of `RAnEn`](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble/2018/11/04/demo-1-RAnEn-basics.html) first. This article skips the part that has been covered in the previous article.\n",

    "The classic `AnEn` algorithm searches for the most similar historical foreasts at its current location. Therefore, only forecasts from the current station/grid point will be traversed and compared. This search style is referred to as the *independent search*. Another possible search style is *extended search*, which is also referred to as *search space extension*. It simply indicates that forecasts at nearby stations/grid points are included in the search process. As a result, the search space is significantly larger by using the search space extension.\n",

    "The first four parameters specify the locations of search and test stations/grid points. The unit is ambiguous unless it is consistent. It is user defined. It can be meters or lat/lon unless it remains the same for all four parameters. No projection is imposed by the package. Therefore any geographic projection should be done prior to the AnEn computation. `num_nearest` is the number of neighbors that should be included into the search space. `distance` is the threshold to include nearby stations. Similarly, the unit of the distance should be consistent with locations. `max_num_search_stations` is an estimated maximum number of nearby stations that could possibily be found. If you are using `num_nearest`, it is a good practice to set `max_num_search_stations` to the same as `num_nearest`. If you are only using `distance`, there is a possibility that too many nearby stations/grid points are found within this distance and there is not enough memory to store all the search data. User should be responsible to provide an upper limit for how many stations should be included for search. In this sense, `max_num_search_stations` is similar to `num_nearest` but `max_num_search_stations` is an optimization parameter and `num_nearest` is a utility parameter. The last parameter `preserve_search_stations` indicates whether to save the search stations in the returned result.\n",
