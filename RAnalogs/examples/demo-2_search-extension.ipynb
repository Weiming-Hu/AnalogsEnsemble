    "This article demonstrates how to use the search space functionality within the `RAnEn` package. If you haven't done so, please read [the instructions for basic usage of `RAnEn`](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble/2018/11/04/demo-1-RAnEn-basics.html) first. This article skips the part that has been covered in the previous article.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic `AnEn` technique searches for the most similar historical foreasts at its current location. Therefore, only forecasts from the current station/grid point will be traversed and compared. This search style is referred to as the *Independent Search (IS)*. Another possible search style is extended search, which is referred to as *Search Space Extension (SSE)*. It simply indicates that forecasts at nearby stations/grid points are included in the search process. As a result, the search space is significantly larger when using the search space extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently two ways to define what nearby locations to be included into the search. Users can set the nearest number of neighbors to be included and/or a distance threshold. The two restraints can be used together.\n",
