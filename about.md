The Analog Ensemble (AnEn) technique provides an efficient and accurate way to generate probabilistic forecasts using deterministic weather prediction models and corresponding historical observations. Please find more introduction in [this post: The Analog Ensemble Technique Explained](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble/2018/12/14/AnEn-explained.html).

Some features of AnEn include:

- Generate ensemble forecasts with only **one** deterministic model run by coupling predictions and observations;
- Scalable;

Some applications of AnEn include:

- Probabilistic weather forecasts;
- Probabilistic energy forecasts;
- model downscaling;

[This package](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble/) is created to facilitate relevant research and projects.

Currently, active research projects are going on to inspect both the scientific and the computational aspects of AnEn. [GEOlab](http://geoinf.psu.edu/) from Penn State is the main inspector on related issues. Contact us if you are looking for collaboration or if you have any questions.

Thank you!
