The Analog Ensemble technique provides an efficient and accurate way to generate probabilistic forecasts using deterministic weather prediction models and corresponding historical observations. This package is created to facilitate relevant research and projects.

Currently, active research projects are going to inspecting both the scientific and the computational aspects of the technique. [GEOlab](http://geoinf.psu.edu/) from Penn State is the main inspector on this issue.

Thanks for reading!
