## About Parallel Analog Ensemble

Parallel Analog Ensemble (PAnEn) is a parallel implementation for Analog Ensemble (AnEn) which generates uncertainty information for a deterministic predictive model. Analogs are generated by using the predictive model and the corresponding historical observations. An introduction to Analog Ensemble technique can be found in [this post](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble/2018/12/14/AnEn-explained.html). It has been successfully applied to forecasts of several weather variables, for example, short-term temperature and wind speed predictions. Publications can be found in the [references](#references).

`PAnEn` is developed by [Geoinformatics and Earth Observation Laboratory](http://geoinf.psu.edu/) at Penn State University. This website contains information for installing and using the `PAnEn` programs and packages. [R](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble/R/) and [C++](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble/CXX/) documentation can be found on the right. [Posts](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble/posts/) for various topics can also be found there, and are organized by [tags](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble/tags.html). If you have any questions, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/Weiming-Hu/AnalogsEnsemble/issues).

This package contains several libraries and applications:

- __AnEn__: The main C++ library. It provides main functionality of the AnEn method;
- __AnEnIO__: The library for file I/O. Currently, it supports reading and writing [standard NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/).
- __RAnEn__: An R wrapper of the C++ library.
- __Apps__: Multiple executables in [the apps folder](https://github.com/Weiming-Hu/AnalogsEnsemble/tree/master/apps) designed for analog computation and data management.

## Requirement and Dependencies

A list of requirement and dependency is provided below. Note that you don't necessarily have to install them all because some of them can be automatically installed or you simply are not installing some components of the program. For example, you won't need R if you only need the C++ program; and you won't need Boost C++ and NetCDF-C if you are only installing the R package `RAnEn`.

| Dependency |                                            Description                                           |
|:----------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    CMake   |                                   Required for the C++ program.                                  |
|  GCC/Clang |                                   Required for the C++ program.                                  |
|  NetCDF-C  |        Optional for the C++ program. If it is not found, the project will try to build it.       |
|  Boost C++ | Optional for the C++ program. It is recommended to let the project build it for the C++ program. |
|   CppUnit  |                         Required for the C++ program when building tests.                        |
|      R     |                                    Required for the R library.                                   |
|   OpenMP   |                                   Optional for both R and C++.                                   |

## Installation

### C++ PAnEn

First, make sure you have already installed the dependencies. Typically GNU compilers with a version later than `4.9`, `netCDF-C`, and `CMake` is required. If you are using MacOS, you probably need to install GNU compilers in order to have `OpenMP` multithreading available.

Then, please clone or download the repository [here](https://github.com/Weiming-Hu/AnalogsEnsemble) and create a `build/` folder under the repository directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/Weiming-Hu/AnalogsEnsemble.git
cd AnalogsEnsemble
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

# If you would like to change the default compiler, specify the compilers like this
#
# CC=[full path to CC] CXX=[full path to CXX] cmake ..

# You can scoll down to explore more parameters for cmake
#
# cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/folder/ -DBOOST_TYPE=SYSTEM [other parameters] ..
```

Read the output messages and make sure there are no errors. If you would like to change parameters for `cmake`, please delete all files in `build/` folder and rerun the `cmake` command.

Then, please compile the programs and the libraries.

```
make

# Or if you are using UNIX system, use the flag -j[number of cores] to parallelize the make process
make -j4

# Build document if needed. The /html and the /man folders will be in your build directory
#
# make document

# If you want to install the program to your machine
#
# make install
```

After the compilation, the programs and libraries should be in the folder `AnalogsEnsemble/output`. Please `cd` into the binary folder `[Where your repository folder is]/AnalogsEnsemble/output/bin/` and run the following command to see help messages.

```
./analogGenerator 
# Analog Ensemble program --- Analog Generator
# Available options:
#  -h [ --help ]             Print help information for options.
#  -c [ --config ] arg       Set the configuration file path. Command line 
#                            options overwrite options in configuration file. 
# ... [subsequent texts ignored]
```

If you want to clean up the folder, please do the following.

```
make clean
```

### RAnEn

_The command is the same for `RAnEn` installation and update._

Generally, R version should be later than or equal to `3.3.0`. And the following R packages are needed:

- [BH](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BH/index.html): `install.packages('Rcpp')`
- [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html): `install.packages('BH')`

If your operating system is `Windows`, please also install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

##### One-Line Solution

The following R command installs the latest version of `RAnEn`.

```
# Read more if OpenMP is not supported
#
install.packages("https://github.com/Weiming-Hu/AnalogsEnsemble/raw/master/RAnalogs/releases/RAnEn_latest.tar.gz", repos = NULL)
```

##### Solution for a Specific Version

If you want to install a specific version of `RAnEn`, you can go to the [release folder](https://github.com/Weiming-Hu/AnalogsEnsemble/tree/master/RAnalogs/releases), copy the full name of the tarball file, replace the following part `[tarball name]` (including the square bracket) with it, and run the command in R.

```
# Read more if OpenMP is not supported
#
install.packages("https://github.com/Weiming-Hu/AnalogsEnsemble/raw/master/RAnalogs/releases/[tarball name]", repos = NULL)
```

**If `Openmp` multithreading is not supported**, or if you simply want to use a different compiler, please create a `Makevars` file under `~/.R`, with the following content.

```
CXX1X=[C++11 compiler]

# required on Mac OS
CXX11=[C++11 compiler]
```
